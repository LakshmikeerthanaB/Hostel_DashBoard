Hostel Performance Management 
## Power BI Project
Designed and implemented a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze and optimize hostel operations using interactive visualizations and dynamic reports. The solution enabled real-time monitoring across key hostel performance metrics.
## Key Features & Functionalities:
Data Integration & Transformation:
Ingested multiple Excel datasets covering student details, hostel resources, room allocation, food consumption, and energy usage.
Used Power Query for data cleaning, null handling, and relationship management across entities.
Created calculated columns and measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for KPIs such as room occupancy, average power consumption, and food wastage.
## Dashboard Modules:
Dashboard Overview: Tracked total students (920), room/bed status, power metrics (avg. 26.99 units), and vacations (248) using KPI cards and gauge visuals.
Student Analysis:
Bar charts for student distribution by block and branch.
Gender split visualization by branch using stacked column charts.
Resource Dashboard:
Aggregated hostel items (e.g., beds, fans, lamps) by type.
Used line and bar charts to show total and unit costs.
Food Analysis:
Visualized total food consumption (182741 kgs), cost (₹1,815,902), and wastage trends for veg/non-veg meals.
Donut chart for daily time-slot based consumption (morning, afternoon, night).
Vacation Tracker:
Filterable list by vacation ID, block ID, and approval status with timeline views for vacate and return dates.
Power Consumption Dashboard:
Monitored usage across fans, coolers, ACs, and gyms.
Month-wise average power consumed vs cost using combo chart.
Tools & Technologies Used:
Power BI (DAX, Power Query, Slicers, Filters, Visual Customization)
